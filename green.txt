 in complete darkness, and Alex was never quite sure
 whether it was an issue of image persistence on her LCD

 the wrong way, probably it was a sign those eyes and
 the cameras behind them never went completely dead,
 be careful, be careful, though really Alex wasn't
 quite sure why semi-secret cameras would come with
 a "rec" light.
