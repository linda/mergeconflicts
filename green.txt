She had bright green eyes that flickered on faintly even
 in complete darkness, and Alex was never quite sure
 whether it was an issue of image persistence on her LCD

 might have asked Carol, only it was obvious she would
 have said that of course it was the camera light, you
 really think they turn it off at night so you can
 sleep? so that wasn't very helpful.
